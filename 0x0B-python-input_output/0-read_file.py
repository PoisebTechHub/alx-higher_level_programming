"""
Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8)
and prints it to stdout:
1. Prototype: def read_file(filename=""):
2. You must use the with statement
3. You donâ€™t need to manage file permission
or file doesn't exist exceptions.
4. You are not allowed to import any module

Below is the solution
"""


def read_file(filename=""):
    """Printing the contents of a UTF8 text file to stdout."""
    with open(filename, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        print(f.read(), end="")
