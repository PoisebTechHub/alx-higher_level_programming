"""
Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line
containing a specific string (see example):

1. Prototype: def append_after(filename="", search_string="", new_string=""):
2. You must use the with statement
3. You donâ€™t need to manage file permission or file doesn't exist exceptions.
4. You are not allowed to import any module

Below is the solution
"""


def append_after(filename="", search_string="", new_string=""):
    """Inserting text after each line containing a given string in a file.

    Args:
        filename (str): Name of the file.
        search_string (str): String to search for within the file.
        new_string (str): String to insert.
    """
    text = ""
    with open(filename) as r:
        for line in r:
            text += line
            if search_string in line:
                text += new_string
    with open(filename, "w") as w:
        w.write(text)
